<h3 style="float:left; clear:left; font-size:150%">Your privacy is of the upmost importance to us.</h3>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p style="float:left; clear:left;">At Apps for Action, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

<ul style="float:left; clear:left;">
  <li>We don’t ask you for personal information we don’t need.</li>
  <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
  <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:100%; float:left; clear:left;">Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have any questions, please <a style="color:#000080" href="mailto:info@appsforaction.com">contact the Apps for Action Team</a>.

<h2 style="font-size:150%;line-height:50%; float:left; clear:left;">Website Visitors</h2>
<p style="font-size:100%; float:left; clear:left;">Like most website operators, Apps for Action collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Apps for Action’s purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand how Apps for Action’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Apps for Action may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the website's usage.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:150%;line-height:50%; float:left; clear:left;">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p style="font-size:100%; float:left; clear:left;">Apps for Action collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users.

<p style="font-size:100%; float:left; clear:left;">Apps for Action discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Apps for Action’s behalf or to provide services available at <a style="color:#000080" href="http://appsforaction.com">appsforaction.com</a>, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <a style="color:#000080" href="http://appsforaction.com">appsforaction.com</a>, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Apps for Action discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Apps for Action believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Apps for Action, third parties or the public at large. Apps for Action takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
