<ul style="float:left; clear:left;">
  <li>We don’t ask you for personal information we don’t need.</li>
  <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
  <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>
